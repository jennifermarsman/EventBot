Will AI Make IT a Strategic Differentiator Again?,3:00 PM,3:30 PM,"In a devastatingly incisive article in 2003, Harvard Business Review stated bluntly, ?IT Doesn?t Matter.? After a decade of treating information technology as a competitive differentiator, the fact that IT had become ubiquitous and affordable to all meant that it was no longer a strategic matter, capable of changing the fate of one company over its peers. But today, artificial intelligence has the potential to once again give companies something that their competitors can?t copy, and can?t beat. But will it, who will do it, how will it happen, and when? Our executive panel lay out the promising points, and a path to get there.","JP (Jean-Pierre) Abello, Danny Lange, David Linthicum",AI Executive Summit Child,,Monday,Cyril Magnin 3,Mark BÅnger,,7,

Keynote: Conversational Agents in the World of Cognitive Computing,11:30 AM,11:50 AM,"Messaging Platforms have become ubiquitous ? they are rapidly becoming the primary way in which people communicate with each other, and with the institutions they work with. This isn?t an accident. It highlights that conversations are a common and natural way for people to communicate with each other. In turn, this trend is also compelling the rise of conversational agents ? aka, Chat-Bots ? that scale up the participation of institutions in these conversations. More importantly, conversational agents also help expedite getting done the things that people want done. However, the utility of those conversational agents are directly correlated to the degree to which that agent can carry on a natural conversation with the user ? not just to do keyword matching, but to really understand the intention and context of the person at the other end. This talk will delve into the role of cognitive computing in facilitating conversational agents within the messaging platform paradigm.

Machine Learning and Security in the Enterprise,3:00 PM,3:45 PM,"Attacks against organizations continue to increase in both volume and complexity. In addition, enterprise architectures continue to rapidly evolve, providing a changing landscape which IT departments are forced to defend. Coupled with the shortage of trained experts to identify and defend against attacks, IT security groups are often playing catchup with the attackers.

Fortunately, there are many problems in the cyber security space that are excellent candidates for approaches based on machine learning. Two properties of the cyber security domain make it an attractive vertical for machine learning approaches. First, there is an enormous amount of data collected and available for decision making. Second, approaches that are predictive and real-time can stop attacks before occurring, while traditional analytical approaches mostly help to identify when an attack has occurred.

Today there are many promising machine learning approaches and start-ups addressing the cyber security problem, and building intelligent security solutions. This panel will discuss what these solutions are, some case studies, and how your organization can find the best approach for using machine learning solutions today.",,The Technologies of Enterprise AI,http://aiworldexpo.com/sessions/panel-real-time-intelligence-security-enterprise/,Tuesday,Cyril Magnin 2,Matt Wolfe,,,

If Trees Could Walk ? Open to all attendees,4:15 PM,5:00 PM,"Trees are well known for their deep roots. The older the tree, the more firmly it is planted into its soil. But what if trees could simply pick up their roots and move from one place to the next? The trees would be at a distinct advantage. So why do corporations, that certainly have the opportunity to be agile and mobile, choose instead to stay deeply grounded by their roots and fail to adapt to change, even when faced with less than optimal conditions? What is the answer for these rooted enterprises? It is to exploit their advantages. That sounds obvious of course but the question is how, and the answer to that is simple ? data.

The wind of change has never blown any faster for the business community, yet the lack of ability of large scale enterprises to adapt and exploit remains their biggest weakness. A weakness which has allowed tech startups to disrupt whole economies. These stories are well understood through the likes of Amazon, Uber and Airbnb, but enterprises continue to look on as if watching a magic trick rather than responding practically. They remain rooted rather than take action, seeing such things as fluke, or anomalies. Yet they are very much not, and success that seems to be conjured out of thin air, is closer to pure science, based on data driven decision making.",ˇLawrence Flynn,Keynote,http://aiworldexpo.com/sessions/keynote-6/,Tuesday,Cyril Magnin Ballroom,,,,
