10,Will AI Make IT a Strategic Differentiator Again?,3:00 PM,3:30 PM,"In a devastatingly incisive article in 2003, Harvard Business Review stated bluntly, “IT Doesn’t Matter.” After a decade of treating information technology as a competitive differentiator, the fact that IT had become ubiquitous and affordable to all meant that it was no longer a strategic matter, capable of changing the fate of one company over its peers. But today, artificial intelligence has the potential to once again give companies something that their competitors can’t copy, and can’t beat. But will it, who will do it, how will it happen, and when? Our executive panel lay out the promising points, and a path to get there.","JP (Jean-Pierre) Abello, Danny Lange, David Linthicum",AI Executive Summit Child,,Monday,Cyril Magnin 3,Mark Bünger,,7
